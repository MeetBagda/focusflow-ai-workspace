/**
 * @fileoverview Defines authentication-related types.
 * Most core auth types are provided by Clerk (e.g., User, Session, Organization).
 * This file can be used for any custom auth-related types specific to your application.
 */

// Example: If you have custom roles or permissions not directly managed by Clerk's default roles
// export type AppUserRole = 'admin' | 'member' | 'guest';

// Example: If you extend Clerk's user metadata
// export interface CustomUserMetadata {
//   themePreference: 'dark' | 'light';
// }

// No specific types needed for now, but keeping the file for future extensibility.
